## Which cdm works?

ChromeCDM: 2160p - 1080p - 720p - SD + Audio

L1:  2160p - 1080p - 720p - SD + Audio

L3: 720p - SD + Audio

(Some cdm l3 work for all resolutions)

## If you're wondering why I just posted it publicly, it's because this was leaked to a lot of people when it was posted in the discord group anyway
(Anyway this was an open project kek)

I know it has nothing to do with what I said above but fuck WVLeaks
